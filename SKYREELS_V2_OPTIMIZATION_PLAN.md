# SkyReels-V2 Performance Optimization Plan

## Executive Summary
This plan aims to optimize SkyReels-V2 pipeline to achieve performance comparable to Wan, the leading video generation model. Based on analysis of both implementations, we've identified key bottlenecks in SkyReels-V2's diffusion forcing approach and propose systematic optimization strategies.

## Current Performance Analysis

### SkyReels-V2 Bottlenecks Identified

1. **Diffusion Forcing Complexity** - Most Critical
   - Separate transformer calls for conditional/unconditional inference
   - Complex timestep matrix generation with O(n²) complexity
   - Sophisticated causal block scheduling overhead

2. **Memory Management Issues**
   - Frequent tensor cloning and copying
   - Large intermediate tensor storage
   - Inefficient GPU memory usage patterns

3. **Computational Overhead**
   - Multiple nested loops (iterations × timesteps × blocks)
   - Complex overlap handling for long videos
   - Redundant conditional logic throughout pipeline

4. **Scheduler Complexity**
   - Multiple scheduler instances (one per frame)
   - Complex timestep matrix computation
   - Asynchronous processing overhead

### Wan's Competitive Advantages

1. **Simple Denoising Loop** - Single forward pass per timestep
2. **Efficient Flow Matching** - Direct path from noise to data
3. **Minimal Conditional Logic** - Streamlined execution path
4. **Optimized Memory Usage** - Single latent tensor throughout process

    combined_embeds = torch.cat([prompt_embeds, negative_prompt_embeds], dim=0)

    # Single transformer forward pass
    combined_output = self.transformer(combined_latents, timestep, combined_embeds)
